[![PureScript](logo.png)](http://purescript.org) - Erlang backend

# WIP

This backend (as opposed to compiler fork) is WIP.

## Overview

A small strongly typed programming language with expressive types, written in and inspired by Haskell.

The original PureScript project compiles to JavaScript, but this fork is a backend targetting Erlang source. The [purerl](https://github.com/purerl) organisation hosts ports of some core libraries.
